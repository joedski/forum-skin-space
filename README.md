Forum Space Skin
================

Just a little skin for a friend's forum.



To Do
-----

- Combine status icon cell with title cell to remove that extra spacing
- Finish regularizing `.layouttable` styles
- Apply `.layouttable` to the demo HTML (especially Message Center)
- Test `.layouttable` by writing the User Settings stuff
- User controls at the top are ugly at small screen widths
